# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

**Frontend Development (React.js):**

Built a responsive user interface using React.js to enable seamless expense tracking and management.
Implemented state management with React Hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage expense data and user inputs.
Created reusable components for modular design, including forms, lists, and summary components.

**Expense Management Features:**

Developed features to add, edit, delete, and categorize expenses with real-time updates.
Integrated expense filtering functionality, allowing users to filter expenses based on date, category, and amount.
Implemented dynamic expense summaries and analytics, including total spending and categorized breakdowns.

**State Management:**

Utilized useState and useReducer for managing local state for expenses, categories, and filters.
Implemented real-time input validation and error handling for form submissions.

**Data Persistence:**

Utilized localStorage to persist user data across sessions, ensuring expenses are saved even after page reloads.
[If applicable] Integrated with Firebase/MongoDB/SQL Database for backend data storage, providing persistent data management.

**Responsive Design:**

Designed a mobile-first, responsive UI using CSS Flexbox/Grid and media queries to ensure compatibility across different screen sizes.
Employed Material-UI/Bootstrap/TailwindCSS to style components for a clean and modern user experience.

**Advanced Features (Optional):**

Implemented budget tracking to alert users when their expenses exceed a predefined budget limit.
Added category-based expense analytics using Chart.js/Recharts to provide visual insights into spending trends.
[If applicable] Added support for multiple currencies with real-time currency conversion using an external API.

**Deployment:**

Deployed the app using Netlify/Vercel, ensuring continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
Configured the build pipeline for production-ready deployment and optimization.

**Version Control and Collaboration:**

Managed code versions with Git and used GitHub for source code management and collaboration.

**API Integration (Optional):**

Integrated with currency exchange APIs to provide real-time currency conversion for international expenses.
Used Firebase Authentication to implement secure user login and session management.
